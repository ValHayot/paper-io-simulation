	\section{Introduction}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item HPC, the bottleneck in I/O and the demand of HPC experiments. 
			\item Difficulties in conducting high performance computing experiments and the need of simulation frameworks.
			\item Existing experiment methods, simulators, simulation frameworks. The advantages of SimGrid compared to others \cite{casanova2008, lebre2015}. The missing of the ability to simulate page cache in SimGrid \cite{lebre2015}.
			\item The objective of the paper: Add capability to simulate I/O with page cache in SimGrid.
		\end{itemize}
	\section{Related Work}			
		
		\subsection{Page cache}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item What is page cache? How it works \cite{linuxdev3rd2010}. Effects and importance of page cache.
				\item Introduce some existing strategies with some highlighted pros and cons.
				\item Current implementation in Linux and some reasons why it is chosen to be implemented (implementation complexity, effectiveness, overhead, etc) \cite{linuxdev3rd2010}
			\end{itemize}									

		\subsection{Simulators}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Discuss some existing methods, simulation frameworks to conduct HPC experiments. Compare pros and cons (accuracy, simulation time, usability) of some simulators (SimGrid, GridSim).
				\item Related development: RAM energy consumption \cite{gill2019} \cite{ouarnoughi2017} 
				\item Discuss the pros of SimGrid and the reasons why we chose it to extend.
			\end{itemize}
			
	\section{Method}

		\subsection{Principle of the simulator}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Approach: generalize dirty data, dirty ratio, cache eviction strategy implemented in Linux. 
				\item Some implemented details of the simulator.
			\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Implementation}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Which features of memory are implemented.
				\item Level of granularity, how features are implemented.
				\item Specific implementation details in python and SimGrid.
			\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Experiments}
			For each experiment: 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Describe data, workflow, number of tasks, task details, environment of each experiment.
				\item Compare the results from real pipeline, baseline SimGrid  and SimGrid with our extension.
			\end{itemize}
	
			\subsubsection{Expriment 1}
				A single pipeline running one node.
			\subsubsection{Expriment 2}
				Multiple pipelines running in parallel on multiple nodes.
			\subsubsection{Expriment 3}
				Same as Experiment 2 but nodes write to a shared file system.
			\subsubsection{Expriment 4}
				A real pipeline (for example a pipeline with nighres)

	\section{Results}
	
		\begin{itemize}

			\item Quantitative results: 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Errors of simulation time and memory used compared to real results.
					\item Simulation time compared to baseline SimGrid.
				\end{itemize} 

			\item Ability of the model to generalize memory trends (dirty data, cache used) and disk throughput.

		\end{itemize}

	\section{Discussion and Future Work}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Sensitivity of the simulator on the variation of memory and disk bandwidth.
